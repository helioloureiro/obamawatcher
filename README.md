During the time of Obama administration, several programs were placed in order to
monitor our lives.   And nothing was done from him to mitigate this.

In order to help them I created long ago a script with Python and Pygame to capture
my picture from times to times.  At the end it helps me to do some nice time
lapsing about my work.

This program was tested only in Linux and running KDE.  So I'm not sure whether it
works or not in other systems.

Installation
------------

Just open clone this repository.  Then:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
